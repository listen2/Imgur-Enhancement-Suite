Imgur Enhancement Suite
=======================

Imgur Enhancement Suite is a browser add-on (userscript) that adds some features to the Imgur galleries.

###Installation

IES can run on any fully-featured modern browser, including most mobile ones. You need to download the file https://raw.github.com/listen2/Imgur-Enhancement-Suite/master/imgur_enhancement_suite.user.js (you may need to right click -> save as) and install it in your browser. The installation process differs between browsers, but here are instructions for some of the big ones:

###FAQ

####Why is this a userscript instead of a packaged extension?
Userscripts are more versatile—they can be installed on browsers for which an extension wouldn't be packaged, including mobile browsers. They also minimize obfuscation of the source code, so interested users can see it for themselves. Finally, packaged applications are hardly more convenient than userscripts if they're not submitted to some sort of central repository, and I have no interest in accommodating the standards of such a repo.
