Imgur Enhancement Suite
=======================

Imgur Enhancement Suite is a browser add-on (userscript) that adds some features to the Imgur galleries.

###Installation

IES can run on any fully-featured modern browser, including most mobile ones. You need to download the file https://raw.github.com/listen2/Imgur-Enhancement-Suite/master/imgur_enhancement_suite.user.js (you may need to right click -> save as) and install it in your browser. The installation process differs between browsers, but here are instructions for some of the big ones:

* Opera: http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/

* Mozilla: Install the [GreaseMonkey extentsion](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then click the link to the file in the paragraph above.

* Chrome: Save the .user.js file. Open ``chrome://chrome/extensions/``. Drag and drop the .user.js file into that page.

* Chrome on Android: use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.biniok.tampermonkey&hl=en (untested—please let me know how it works)

* Internet Explorer: nope

* Safari: http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/11/14/how-to-run-greasemonkey-scripts-in-safari/ (untested—please let me know how it works)

* Android Browser: use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.biniok.tampermonkey&hl=en (untested—please let me know how it works)

* iPad and maybe iPhone: http://userscripts.org/topics/70361 (untested—please let me know how it works)

###FAQ

####Why isn't this a packaged extension?
I don't believe there's any advantage to a "full" browser extension over a userscript. Furthermore, this form allows users to easily install it in userscript-compliant browsers without my support.
