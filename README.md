Imgur Enhancement Suite
=======================

Imgur Enhancement Suite is a browser add-on (userscript) that adds some features to the Imgur galleries.

###Installation

IES can run on any fully-featured modern browser, including most mobile ones. You need to download the file https://raw.github.com/listen2/Imgur-Enhancement-Suite/master/imgur_enhancement_suite.user.js (you may need to right click -> save as) and install it in your browser. The installation process differs between browsers, but here are instructions for some of the big ones:

###FAQ

####Why isn't this a packaged extension?
I don't believe there's any advantage to a "full" browser extension over a userscript. Furthermore, this form allows users to easily install it in userscript-compliant browsers without my support.
